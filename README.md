## Contributing

We welcome any and all contributions! First, start by forking the repo and downloading the files for your fork.

Then you'll want to install a way to see your changes locally for testing them out. Since the site is fully JavaScript, any basic hosting method will work. In my current workflow, I use the "Live Server" extension in VSCode (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to quickly host the project locally for testing.

Once you've tested out your changes, make a PR and tell us what's changing and why! We'll give it a review and, if it passes review, your changes will be in! (If you're uncertain about whether we'd want certain changes, make an Issue instead! We can answer that there.)
